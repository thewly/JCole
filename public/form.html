          <p class="card-text text-center">Since learning about the clam gardens in the Puget Sound area near Seattle,
            I’ve been intrigued by the people who developed them. These gardens are upwards of 5000 years old, according
            to archeological findings, but modern scientific research confirms that their methods did (and do), in fact,
            produce better quality clams and a higher yield, thus improving food security: “…Overall, clam gardens
            contained 4 times as many butter clams and over twice as many littleneck clams relative to non-walled
            beaches. As predicted, this relationship varied as a function of intertidal height, whereby clam density and
            biomass tended to be greater in clam gardens compared to non-walled beaches at relatively higher intertidal
            heights. Transplanted juvenile L. staminea grew 1.7 times faster and smaller size classes were more likely
            to survive in clam gardens than non-walled beaches, specifically at the top and bottom of beaches.
            Consequently, we provide strong evidence that ancient clam gardens likely increased clam productivity by
            altering the slope of soft-sediment beaches, expanding optimal intertidal clam habitat, thereby enhancing
            growing conditions for clams. These results reveal how ancient shellfish aquaculture practices may have
            supported food security strategies in the past and provide insight into tools for the conservation,
            management, and governance of intertidal seascapes today.
            (Groesbeck AS, Rowell K, Lepofsky D, Salomon AK (2014) Ancient Clam Gardens Increased Shellfish Production:
            Adaptive Strategies from the Past Can Inform Food Security Today.”

            Who were these ingenious clam-farmers? And what do we know about their descendants there today? “Salish”
            encompasses many tribes of the Pacific Northwest, spreading from British Columbia down through the Puget
            Sound area of the United States’ western shoreline and expanding inland

              Indigenous peoples. Apparently it doesn’t enjoy the seeming near-constant study that, for example, the
              Diné do (remembering the joke about every Navajo family including a father, mother, children, and an
              archeologist). Suitable reference material through my libraries and on the Internet was limited, and I
              almost changed direction more than once. However, this ancient society that had figured out and utilized a
              system that modern science verifies helps the food supply and ecosystem remain my chosen subject.</p>

              handful of Native speakers, most elderly in age. It is estimated that by 2050 most of the remaining
              languages will be extinct, due to younger generations not learning and using the tongue of their
              grandmothers. The tragedy of dying languages lies in the fact that each language encapsulates its own
              culture, history, place names, and sacred references. So when the language dies, a huge part of the
              culture dies with it- even though the DNA of the remaining peoples may continue on. </p>

            A smallpox epidemic in the late 1700’s (just prior to European explorers coming from the eastern part of the
            continent) wiped out an estimated 70% of the Salish peoples. The smallpox epidemic is speculated to have
            come from contact with peoples from the south. Here’s one account of their first encounter with the Salish,
            whom they had supposed would be very numerous, but they saw only a few:
            ‘On May 21, 1792, Peter Puget discovered further signs of this disease on the Puget Sound residents. While
            Lieutenant Puget explored the southern reaches of the sound soon to receive his name, he met some Indians in
            a canoe. He stated that “Two of the three in the Canoe had lost the Right Eye & were much pitted with the
            Small Pox, which Disorder in all probability is the Cause of that Defect…” (Peter Puget, PNW Quarterly,
            198). On August 18, 1792, while near the Queen Charlotte Islands, Peter Puget gave a summary description of
            the Indians of Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia: “[T]he Small pox most have had, and most terribly
            pitted they are; indeed many have lost their Eyes, & no Doubt it has raged with uncommon Inacteracy among
            them.” (Robert Boyd, The Coming of the Spirit of Pestilence (Vancouver, BC: UBC Press, 1999), 22-24, 27-30,
            34, 36-37, 55, 204-205, 273, 293-295)’

            A missionary/researcher from England, Charles Hill-Tout, had loved time spent in the Vancouver area and
            eventually returned there with his family to settle among the Indians he was fascinated with. He had lived
            among them previously and recorded “a young chief of the Chehalis Indians and his wife, who had been
            recently married, gave up their bedroom to me and also their bedding while they slept upon the floor of the
            kitchen for two weeks.” (Hill-Tout, Charles: The Salish People, The Local Contribution of Charles Hill-Tout
            Volume ii: The Squamish and the Lillooet, Edited with an introduction by Ralph Maud, pg 17).
            During his missionary time, Hill-Tout met Chief Mischelle and found him to be a great talker, so he wrote
            down all the legends, stories, and history that Mischelle had to tell. This turned out to be extremely
            fortuitous, since this chief took ill about a year later. In about 1899, Chief Mischelle “was looking
            forward to the time when he would be so far recovered as to be able to take a sweat-bath”, but died soon
            after. Fortunately the stories recorded by Hill-Tout were published. (“Sqaktkquacit, or the Benign-faced,
            the Cannes of the Ntlakapamuq, British Columbia”).
            The words of the Chief, as recorded by Hill-Tout, give us many of the Salish tales in a respectful, if not
            perfect, form. Hill-Tout’s many asides describing the Chief reveal Hill-Tout’s utter adoration of this
            individual and the culture he passed on through his stories. For example, in a section where the Squamish
            dead were described, he wrote, ”Here the old man’s voice was hushed to a plaintive wail, and the faces of
            his audience were an eloquent index of the tragic interest of this story of their ancestors’ misfortunes”
            (Hill-Tout, vol ii pg 17) .
            One of the tales told by Chief Mishelle describes a personified woodpecker (the red ‘cap’ he wore having
            been given previously as a reward for noble behavior) who is married to two wives: a black bear and a
            grizzly. Each bore him three sons, but eventually jealousy brings one wife to plot against the other and
            leads to both wives’ deaths, the woodpecker’s demise, and the deaths of half his children- one being
            accidentally eaten by his own mother! The Chief, noted Hill-Tout, loved to relate these many stories from
            his culture, and would talk literally until the audience was falling asleep (Hill-Tout vol. ii).
