                    Since learning about the clam gardens in the Puget Sound area near Seattle,
                    I’ve been intrigued by the people who developed them. These gardens are carbon-dated upwards of 5000
                    years old,
                    according
                    to archeological findings, but modern scientific research confirms that their methods did (and do),
                    in
                    fact,
                    produce better quality clams and a higher yield, thus improving food security:
                  </div>
                  <div class="pIndent">
                    “…Overall, clam gardens
                    contained 4 times as many butter clams and over twice as many littleneck clams relative to
                    non-walled
                    beaches. As predicted, this relationship varied as a function of intertidal height, whereby clam
                    density
                    and
                    biomass tended to be greater in clam gardens compared to non-walled beaches at relatively higher
                    intertidal
                    heights. Transplanted juvenile L. staminea grew 1.7 times faster and smaller size classes were more
                    likely
                    to survive in clam gardens than non-walled beaches, specifically at the top and bottom of beaches.
                    Consequently, we provide strong evidence that ancient clam gardens likely increased clam
                    productivity by
                    altering the slope of soft-sediment beaches, expanding optimal intertidal clam habitat, thereby
                    enhancing
                    growing conditions for clams. These results reveal how ancient shellfish aquaculture practices may
                    have
                    supported food security strategies in the past and provide insight into tools for the conservation,
                    management, and governance of intertidal seascapes today.

              their
              grandmothers. The tragedy of dying languages lies in the fact that each language encapsulates its own
              culture, history, place names, and sacred references. So when the language dies, a huge part of the

              A smallpox epidemic in the late 1700’s (just prior to European explorers coming from the eastern part of
              the

              ‘On May 21, 1792, Peter Puget discovered further signs of this disease on the Puget Sound residents.
              While
              Lieutenant Puget explored the southern reaches of the sound soon to receive his name, he met some
              Indians
              in
              a canoe. He stated that “Two of the three in the Canoe had lost the Right Eye & were much pitted with

              the Indians of Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia: “[T]he Small pox most have had, and most terribly

                A missionary/researcher from England, Charles Hill-Tout, had loved time spent in the Vancouver area
                and
                eventually returned there with his family to settle among the Indians he was fascinated with. He had
                lived
                among them previously and recorded “a young chief of the Chehalis Indians and his wife, who had been
                recently married, gave up their bedroom to me and also their bedding while they slept upon the floor
                of
                the
                kitchen for two weeks.” (Hill-Tout, Charles: The Salish People, The Local Contribution of Charles
                Hill-Tout
                Volume ii: The Squamish and the Lillooet, Edited with an introduction by Ralph Maud, pg 17).
              </div>
              <div class="pIndent">
                During his missionary time, Hill-Tout met Chief Mischelle and found him to be a great talker, so he
                wrote
                down all the legends, stories, and history that Mischelle had to tell. This turned out to be extremely
                fortuitous, since this chief took ill about a year later. In about 1899, Chief Mischelle “was looking
                forward to the time when he would be so far recovered as to be able to take a sweat-bath”, but died
                soon
                after. Fortunately the stories recorded by Hill-Tout were published. (“Sqaktkquacit, or the
                Benign-faced,
                the Cannes of the Ntlakapamuq, British Columbia”).
              </div>
              <div class="pIndent">
                The words of the Chief, as recorded by Hill-Tout, give us many of the Salish tales in a respectful, if
                not
                perfect, form. Hill-Tout’s many asides describing the Chief reveal Hill-Tout’s utter adoration of this
                individual and the culture he passed on through his stories. For example, in a section where the
                Squamish
                dead were described, he wrote, ”Here the old man’s voice was hushed to a plaintive wail, and the faces
                of
                his audience were an eloquent index of the tragic interest of this story of their ancestors’
                misfortunes”
                (Hill-Tout, vol ii pg 17) .
              </div>
              <div class="pIndent">
                One of the tales told by Chief Mishelle describes a personified woodpecker (the red ‘cap’ he wore
                having
                been given previously as a reward for noble behavior) who is married to two wives: a black bear and a
                grizzly. Each bore him three sons, but eventually jealousy brings one wife to plot against the other
                and
                leads to both wives’ deaths, the woodpecker’s demise, and the deaths of half his children- one being
                accidentally eaten by his own mother! The Chief, noted Hill-Tout, loved to relate these many stories
                from
                his culture, and would talk literally until the audience was falling asleep (Hill-Tout vol. ii).

                informed
                me. I know in Canada they give us a tribal card and a band number. I registered Louise and Anslo both
                in
                Canada in my tribe. I believe their kids will not qualify, though. I don’t know what the exact
                percentage
                is, but for their kids won’t qualify for membership unless they marry another band member or even a
                Canadian
                Native.

                With the imaginary border between Canada and the U.S., if Vileena were to move to Canada she wouldn’t
                be
                recognized as a First Nation or a Native because she’s Navajo from the U.S. But luckily for me the
                U.S.
                usually recognizes a Canadian Native. I don’t know why that. From my experience, maybe there are
                loopholes,
                but when we were contemplating moving up there or having Vileena come up for different things that she
                wasn’t able to really get anything or to show that she was a Native America or First Nations person.
                CS: As far as your kis…what have you tried to teach them as far as culturally from …your cultural
                perspective or maybe Vileena’s because she’s Navajo?

                NP: I am teaching them values and principles of obedience, honesty and integrity. As far as cultural
                things,
                one of the main reasons why we go to Canada every summer is to go berry picking and to go salmon
                fishing.
                That’s a very big part of my life that I grew up with and I really enjoy. It’s deep in our culture.
                Every
                year there’s a big salmon fish, and we get enough salmon to last us all year.
                …One fish tradition is we use a dipnet and gillnets. We don’t fish with a pole or bait, so I want to
                implement that. We berry pick. I want to find local fruits and foods. Of course, Native Americans did
                that
                for a sense of survival. It is sort of mountain men… and having a sense of being able to teach a
                respect
                for
                Mother Nature and to realize that she’s the one that provides for us. I try to take my kids camping
                and to
                help them recognize that and be respectful.

              A recent article about today’s Salish returning to ancient practices gives hope for the Nation’s future:
              “Clam gardens have been around on the British Columbia, Alaskan, and Washington state coasts for over
              3000
              years," Augustine says.
              After colonization, those gardens fell into disuse. Now, Augustine is running the first project since
              then
              to restore the gardens in British Columbia. The Swinomish's would be the first revival of this tradition
              in
              the U.S.
              At the annual Swinomish clam bake, more than a hundred tribal members gathered at long tables at a beach
              on
              the reservation, eating all kinds of shellfish.
              "There's the old Indian saying in this part of the world that when the tide is out the table is set,"
              Swinomish elder Larry Campbell says, "because the clams are in our tideland."
              The goal of the clam garden is to keep the table set.
              The Swinomish Tribe hopes that its new garden will be built as soon as next summer, in time for the next
              clam bake.”

              So whether we are appreciating the ingenious seafood harvesting (a renewal of ancient practices),
              reading
              the long history and cultural variety of the Salish, or appreciating part of their recorded oral
              history,
              we
              can see that the Salish were anciently a large and varied collection of peoples which still today are
              making
              their voices heard all across the western U.S, Canada, and B. C.
